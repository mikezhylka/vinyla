Vinyla Corner: Where Music Spins Its Best Stories!

This is an online store where you can buy vinyl records. For current moment only Shop section is available. It means, you can navigate to it through BUY buttons on Home page or by clicking BUY IN ONE CLICK in top bar / menu. Also you can open Product page, add it to favorites, adjust its quantity and add to cart. In cart section, customer can change product's quantity or delete it and also fill a form, but values in inputs must be correct: validation is added. Please, fill form in English and write existing country in corresponding input. Form consists of 3 steps: Shopping cart, Checkout details and Confirmation. For now I am creating other sections and adding a possibility to add comments. This project was created using React with TypeScript, navigation was written in React Router. For CSS framework, SASS was chosen with BEM methodology. Figma design is available at [this link]: https://www.figma.com/design/nBrWSDW3mf1sgOlWxod1ZQ/Design?node-id=0-1&t=Ukwq32gBlFLcQj0N-1
